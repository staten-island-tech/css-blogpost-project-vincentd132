        <p class="blog1-description">Seals are intriguing marine mammals known for their playful nature and streamlined bodies, which make them agile swimmers. They come in various species, such as the harbor seal and elephant seal, each adapted to different environments. Social animals, they often live in large colonies and communicate with vocalizations and body language. While their diet includes fish and squid, many seal species face threats from climate change and human activities, highlighting the need for conservation.
